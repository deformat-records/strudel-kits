# WAVE TABLES (/wt)

This section is generated wavetables, as well as morphing wavetables
These are all designed to be single cycle 16 bit wav with a 44100 sample rate 
 and 1024 samples per cycle

They were all generated with numpy, and the scripts used to generate them will
be included eventually.
