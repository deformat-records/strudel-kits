# Gabber Master

This entire folder can be loaded as a multi sample kit.
Or each individual subfolder (each has its own independant strudel.json)

All kicks made using my old Gabber Master VST, which I made about 20 years ago.
There is 7 variations of each, eith variations affecting EQ and noise factor

## Current Kits:

MerrikKick1 - An aggressive gabber kick that was a preset on GabberMaster
MerrikKick2 - A deeper more classic oldschool gabber kick
MerrikKick3 - A more aggressive gabber kick suitable for breakcore (try a lpf on it)
MerrikKick4 - Another Gabber Kick
MerrikKick5 - A fifth gabber kick, surprise surprise.
